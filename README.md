The complete project involved the end-to-end development of a social media mobile app with android support. 
The app is made up of three main parts:
* A server (Application Server), responsible for connecting the users. It can be found [here](https://github.com/RodrigoDeRosa/PicappAppServer)
* A server (Shared Server), responsible for administrating the application servers, user authentication, and files handling. It can be found [here](https://github.com/marcossch/PicAppSharedServer)
* An Android client to be used by the final users. It can be found [here](https://github.com/marcossch/PicAppAndroid)

My personal involvement in the project was on the Android Client and the Shared Server.

### Android client

The app provides:
* Login and Register via Google Account.
* Main Feed that contains user's posts with location, title description, 4 different reactions to the post, comments section, and support of both video and image. Organized by a vertical scroll view.
* Friendship relations between users.
* Chat between users.
* Personal profile page with views by post or by location in Google Maps.
* Push notifications.
* Flash posts of a shorter duration. Organized by a vertical scroll and carousel view.
